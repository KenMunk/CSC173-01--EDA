  <h2>Initial Analysis Questions</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Q1: What areas of the town are most busy?</li>
    <li>Q2: Where are the primary corridors of travel?</li>
    <li>Q3: Where do people typically spend their time in the categories of work, eating, and recreation?  Specific buildings are not necessary as the intent is to identify hubs of activity rather than popular destinations.</li>
	<li>Q4: Where are the participants distributed housing wise?</li>
	<li>Q5: Which blocks should be prioritized for transit hubs?</li>

  <h2>Discoveries &amp; Insights</h2>
  
  <h3> Areas of activity </h3>
  
  <div class="entry">
    <img src="Q1a--TimeDistribution.png" />
    <p class="caption">
	<br>
    This was the initial attempt at investigating where hubs of activity were located.  This initial attempt at identifying where the participants are spending their time used a count of the individual timestamps in both participant status logs and plotting those values into a density map overlaid on the map of the town.  Unfortunately, it was found that density maps any sort of so in order to adhere to conventional understandings of heat maps.<br><br>
	
	What was found in this heat map was, in addition to the hot zones of local commercial zones, the heat map was also highlighting residential areas strongly.
	
    </p>

  <div class="entry">
    <img src="Q1a--HomeTimeDistribution.png" />
    <p class="caption">
	
    In order to understand the importance and relationship of the time spent at home and it's associated mark on the time density map in the previous image, the time distribution at home was analyzed.  The initial hypothesis was that the traditional person still goes to work outside of home and therefore primarily uses the location of home as a place of sleep primarily.<br><br>
	The near 75% distribution of time spent sleeping at home clearly supports this hypothesis.  The key takeaway here was that there should really be a lesser priority placed on valuing home time distribution and more priority placed on places where people actively seek to spend time.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="entry">

    <p class="caption">
	
    This next heat map completely ignores any updates that are of a mode that is at home.  Although it removes a vast majority of the updates since more than half of all updates are when the participant is at their residence it does highlight all other areas that are frequented.  In this heat map, the activity levels are counted in terms of unique participants found at each area rather than the count of their overall occurrence since in places like work-from-home offices, a single participant would likely have been in the same general location all day without really moving much.  This means that said location could be marked as an extremely hot location when in reality it's one person with their hips grafted to their desk.<br><br>With this heat map it was found that people generally seek to go to areas of recreation rather than areas of food.  A surprising finding here was the fact that despite a strong overall distribution of employment in the map, the actual hot zones for employment activity are only in the middle-right branch of the map where there is a small corporate village stationed.  A somewhat unsurprising finding was the level of overall density found along what are presumed to be the primary transportation corridors of the town.  When transportation was filtered out, it was found that several of the hot zones had disappeared due to a lack of heavy traffic.     
    </p>
  </div>
  
  <h3> Corridors of travel </h3>

  <div class="entry">
    <img src="Q2--Corridors of travel.png" />
    <p class="caption">
	
    The previous chart got me to focus more on the transportation density out of curiosity.  This heat map was generated by filtering for only transportation updates and then counting the participant ids found on the map in those areas.  What was mildly unsurprising was the overwhelming fact that the tool tips for a vast majority of points even in the hotter areas except closer to some of the more central hubs of activity consist of only 1 or maybe 2 participants at a single point in the entire log.  Compounded with the fact that the coordinates were rounded to the nearest whole number, this heat map strongly indicates the type of density indicative of strong personal vehicle usage.  
    </p>
  </div>

  <h3> Hubs of activity </h3>
  
  <div class="entry">
    <img src="Q3a--ActivityHubs.png" />
    <p class="caption">
	
    This chart was the first of many following a block layout of 250 distance units by 250 distance units.  This is following the assumption that each of the buildings are approximately 50 units and that only critically disabled peoples would be unable to make such a distance to a common stopping point for transit.  What was found was that the overall distribution of activity for work was extremely broad while the distribution for recreation and food was extremely low.  It may potentially play into why areas near recreation and food are generally high traffic for transportation.  This surprise is further increased by the fact that your areas where there is a high concentration of work generally also has a very low concentration of transportation traffic.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="entry">
    <img src="Q3b--LevelsHubActivity.png" />
    <p class="caption">
	
    When looking at those same hubs of activity in a series of bar charts, the overall trend is confirmed.  By an overwhelming margin more people seek to congregate at entertainment or recreation rather than any single place of employment or food.  Could this be due to the fact that there is simply so few places of possible recreation or entertainment both free and paid?
    </p>
  </div>

  <h3> Hubs of residence </h3>
  
  <div class="entry">
    <img src="Q4--ParticipantDwellingDistribution.png" />
    <p class="caption">
	
    The hubs of residence map also uses the 250 by 250 distance unit zone sizes for zone analysis.  This is primarily because it was initially found that individual points of residence usually indicated 1-4 people rather than the larger volumes necessary to really justify the placement of a transportation option investment within those areas.  My initial hypothesis was that the centers of activity for work, recreation, and eating were generally separated from places of residence.  This was generally confirmed since it was found that the vast majority of participants resided within housing districts within the top half of the map while a small minority of participants resided in the lower half with a large potion of buildings left unused.  What was truly surprising was the fact that so many buildings were unused within the lower zones.  Could it be due to the proximity those homes have to other things like work and recreation?
    </p>

  <div class="entry">
    <img src="Q1a--TimeDistribution.png" />
    <p class="caption">
	
    This first heat map was brought back down as a comparison of the two maps showing that those areas of moderate time activity were indeed people sitting or sleeping at home.
    </p>
  </div>

  <h3> Zone prioritization </h3>
  
  <div class="entry">
    <img src="Q5--ZonePrioritization.png" />
    <p class="caption">
	
    In this chart, we are looking at zones not in the bottom 10% of all zones for utilization.  It shows that the zones at -250,5000 and -250, 4000 should both be prioritized as transit hubs to help facilitate the bringing of people to their places of recreation in a more efficient manner.  In addition to those zones, other slightly less high priority zones are worthy of prioritization in transportation mapping to enable people in their effort to get to areas that they desire to be in.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="entry">
    <img src="Q5--PrioritizedHubsMap.png" />
    <p class="caption">
	
    Unfortunately, without reference to a map, such a bar chart is rather useless.  Taking those same prioritized zones and configuring the same conditions, all of the prioritized zones are marked with an orange arrow while all candidate stops are marked in red to allow for people to get to their destination in a timely manner while not having to walk for half a mile to do so.

    <h3>Summary</h3>
    <p>
    The main lessons derived from this exercise was that the simulated town, which is most likely modeled after a modern town within the United States is somewhat poorly configured for the uses that the participants seek.  Participants spent nearly a quarter of their time in transportation in order to go to work or to recreate.  Furthermore, the lack of more of a mixed distribution of things like restaurants also likely contributed to the fact that there are several extremely hot zones of activity while the broader distribution of activity is moderate to low at best.  Although it was found where the ideal locations for transit hubs should be placed, it was also found that the out-of-house distribution of activity and perceived desire were areas of recreation generally.  With that in mind, the lack of any recreation or
